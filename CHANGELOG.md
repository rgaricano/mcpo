## [0.0.9] - 2025-04-06

### Added

- 🧭 **Clearer Docs Navigation with Path Awareness**: Optimized the /docs and /[tool]/docs pages to clearly display full endpoint paths when using mcpo --config, making it obvious where each tool is hosted—no more guessing or confusion when running multiple tools under different routes.
- 🛤️ **New --path-prefix Option for Precise Routing Control**: Introduced optional --path-prefix flag allowing you to customize the route prefix for all mounted tools—great for integrating mcpo into existing infrastructures, reverse proxies, or multi-service APIs without route collisions.
- 🐳 **Official Dockerfile for Easy Deployment**: Added a first-party Dockerfile so you can containerize mcpo in seconds—perfect for deploying to production, shipping models with standardized dependencies, and running anywhere with a consistent environment.

## [0.0.8] - 2025-04-03

### Added

- 🔒 **SSL Support via '--ssl-certfile' and '--ssl-keyfile'**: Easily enable HTTPS for your mcpo servers by passing certificate and key files—ideal for securing deployments in production, enabling encrypted communication between clients (e.g. browsers, AI agents) and your MCP tools without external proxies.

## [0.0.7] - 2025-04-03

### Added

- 🖼️ **Image Content Output Support**: mcpo now gracefully handles image outputs from MCP tools—returning them directly as binary image content so users can render or download visuals instantly, unlocking powerful new use cases like dynamic charts, AI art, and diagnostics through any standard HTTP client or browser.

## [0.0.6] - 2025-04-02

### Added

- 🔐 **CLI Auth with --api-key**: Secure your endpoints effortlessly with the new --api-key option, enabling basic API key authentication for instant protection without custom middleware or external auth systems—ideal for public or multi-agent deployments.
- 🌐 **Flexible CORS Access via --cors-allow-origins**: Unlock controlled cross-origin access with the new --cors-allow-origins CLI flag—perfect for integrating mcpo with frontend apps, remote UIs, or cloud dashboards while maintaining CORS security.

### Fixed

- 🧹 **Cleaner Proxy Output**: Dropped None arguments from proxy requests, resulting in reduced clutter and improved interoperability with servers expecting clean inputs—ensuring more reliable downstream performance with MCP tools.
